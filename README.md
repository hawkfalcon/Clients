# Clients

An iPhone app to track any client data.

This app was orginally created for my mother's small business. She needed an app to track her clients payments. I received permission to open source it and generify it. 

Feel free to submit any pull requests or create issues.

### Features

* Track client data
* Stores client contact, a category, miles driven, and notes
* Choose Contract or Consultation categories (more to come)
* Export data as a CSV file

### TODO

- [] Allow data importing (1/2 complete)
- [] Switch to use core data
- [] Continue to refactor and make more generic 
- [] Add settings for color, toggle mileage, etc
- [] Make categories customizable in-app, completely dynamic
